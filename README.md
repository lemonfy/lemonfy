A simple company-review web app built with MEAN stack.

**Featuring:**

1. **Authentic reviews**
A rating submitted here is not visible until the reviewer clicks a link in the verification email we send to her/his corporate email account. This way, we can be sure that reviews are written by people who really work for the company.
2. **Truly anonymous**
We don't keep your corporate email address. We just keep its hash for 3 months so that one email address can only do one review within this period. That is, you are free to submit different reviews but only the last verified will be kept. If a review does not change after 3 months we will erase the hash and the review becomes "history" for good.
3. **One rating rules all**
Instead of having to rate on different factors, like "culture", "compensation", etc, you just pick one rating. Done. In case you want to share your thoughts with the world we have provided a comments area.
